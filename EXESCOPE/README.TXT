                                  eXeScope


1. What is eXeScope

   Do you want to customize an application ?  For example,
     Change font,
     Change menu,
     Change size or layout of dialog,
     Change Icon,
     etc.,
   but do you think that it is impossible because you have not source files ?
   eXeScope is a resource editor which can edit executable files directly. 
   It can analyze and rewrite resources of EXE, DLL, OCX, etc. without source
   files. Almost all resources, that is, Menu, Dialog, String, MessageTable,
   Icon, Cursor, Bitmap, Accelerator, VersionInfo, Delphi Form, WAVE, MIDI,
   AVI, GIF, HTML, JPEG, ToolBar are supported.
   Moreover, eXeScope can analyze and display exported/imported functions
   and TypeLibrary in DLL, OCX, etc.
